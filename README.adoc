= Google Cloud and Node, and Quay.io


This project is an exploration into how gcloud can be used to spin up node js
app in googles PaaS offering on Google Compute Engine. I thought it would be
cool as well to use CoreOS registry; Quay.io.

There isn't anything special about this project, it was just something I wanted
to do and follow the k8's guide to see some differences between it and OSE.
